# AWESOME-misinformation-detection

As part of our Data Science & AI specialisation we chose to tackle the problem of fake news on twitter. We found to public datasets with labelled tweets and applied different classification algorithms.


## Infodemic Dataset 

The first dataset we used was taken from a paper called [Fighting an Infodemic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03327). The authors manually annotated a dataset of 10,700 social media posts and articles of real and fake news on COVID-19.

## TruthSeeker Dataset

The second dataset is one of the most extensive benchmark datasets with more than 180.000 labels from 2009 to 2022 from a paper called [TruthSeeker: The Largest Social Media Ground-Truth Dataset for Real/Fake Content](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/TruthSeeker_The_Largest_Social_Media_Ground-Truth_Dataset_for_Real_Fake_Content/22795130/1).
